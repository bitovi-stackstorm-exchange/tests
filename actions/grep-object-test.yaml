  I have an orquesta workflow where I am trying to use kv.grep_object with a list of prefixes and then assemble the results into a single list of kv objects.
  The calls return succeeded() 
  but if the grep returns nothing, result().result errors when I try to reference it.
  When I look at result(), result exists whether the grep found anything or not. 

  Objective: to determine if I am going to be able to add result().result to my final list.
  Or maybe some direction of a better approach.
